# libft



The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that we‚Äôll be allowed to use in all our other projects
at ecole 42 we are not allowed to use standard C library functions, we can use only functions we coded ourself. 
So the longer term goal of this library is to grow with our own coded functions.

# üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Requirements

This program is written in C language for Linux distributions and thus needs the clang compiler and some standard C libraries to run.
