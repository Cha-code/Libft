# Library fortytwo
This Library is recreating some of the functions of C standard library just to get an understanding of the way these functions works, 
implemented and learn how to use them. 

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that weâ€™ll be allowed to use in all our other projects. 
At 42 we are not allowed to use standard C library functions, we can use only functions we coded ourself. 
So the longer term goal of this library is to grow with our own coded functions.
